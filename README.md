This is a TypeScript implementation of the Bowling Game Kata.
An introduction and walk-through can be found here: https://mitchell-fyi.notion.site/TDD-Bowling-Game-Kata-b1bb1b6e1f9744f790ab681d9cae79a8

It includes a basic test runner and framework for writing tests in (./src/testing.ts)[./src/testing.ts]

This app is designed to show when, how and what to write tests for.

It is split into 6 stages, with each stage adding more functionality and getting increasingly complex.

You can run it using the following CLI commands:

    npm run test:1
    npm run test:2
    npm run test:3
    npm run test:4
    npm run test:5
    npm run test:6

With step 6 being the full implementation.
