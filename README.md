This is a TypeScript implementation of the Bowling Game Kata.

[An introduction and walk-through](https://mitchell-fyi.notion.site/TDD-Bowling-Game-Kata-b1bb1b6e1f9744f790ab681d9cae79a8) is the best place to start.

It includes a basic test runner and framework for writing tests in [./src/testing.ts](./src/testing.ts)

This app is designed to show when, how and what to write tests for.

It is split into 5 testing phases, with each stage adding more functionality and getting increasingly complex.

You can run it using the following CLI commands:

    npm run test:1
    npm run test:2
    npm run test:3
    npm run test:4
    npm run test:5

With test 5 being the full implementation.
